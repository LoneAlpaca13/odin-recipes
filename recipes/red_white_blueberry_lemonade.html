    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (packed) fresh strawberry halves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (packed) fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>6 lemons, organic preferred, or more as needed (you may need as many as 10 lemons)</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step-1</h3>
    <p>Combine strawberries, blueberries, and 1/2 of the sugar in a bowl. Use a potato masher to lightly crush berries until all blueberries have broken open.</p>
    <h3>Step-2</h3>
    <p>Use a sharp vegetable peeler to peel off just the yellow zest from 6 lemons; add lemon zest to the berry-sugar mixture.</p>
    <h3>Step-3</h3>
    <p>Pour remaining sugar into the bowl and mix thoroughly. Cover and let sit on the counter for 2 to 6 hours, stirring occasionally, or refrigerate overnight if you prefer.</p>
    <h3>Step-4</h3>
    <p>Bring 5 cups water to boil in a saucepan, transfer in berry mixture. Immediately turn off heat, and let sit for 5 minutes, stirring a few times.</p>
    <h3>Step-5</h3>
    <p>Set a fine mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl, and pour berry mixture through the strainer; press out liquid gently. Let cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step-6</h3>
    <p>Cut the 6 zested lemons in half, and squeeze the juice (through a strainer to catch the seeds) into the bowl.</p>
    <h3>Step-7</h3>
    <p>Taste, and juice in more lemons as desired. You will have another chance to adjust the final flavor after the lemonade is cold. </p>
    <h3>Step-8</h3>
    <p>Transfer lemonade into a pitcher and refrigerate until fully chilled, about 1 hour. Give the lemonade a final taste, and adjust with more fresh lemon juice or sugar if necessary. Fill glasses with ice to serve.
